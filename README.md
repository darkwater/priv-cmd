Still really a WIP but it's the most complete priv program for now.

- Bookmarks are stored in "commands".
- Run `-a command` to add `command` as bookmark.
- Run `-r command` to remove the `command` bookmark.
- Run `-al command` to add `command` as bookmark but only for this host (local). These are stored in "commands:_hostname_"
